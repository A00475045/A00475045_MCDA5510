SUMMARY: 
We are three passionate students from India: Siddharth Singh, Raj Mehta, and Ranjit Pandey. We all share a deep love for Cricket, a sport that holds a special place in our hearts. Cricket, a bat-and-ball game, is one of the most popular sports in India, known for its thrilling matches and legendary players.

We are drawn to Cricket because it's not just a game; it's a part of our culture and identity. It brings people together, fostering a sense of unity and excitement. Our collective enthusiasm for this sport has led us to form a team dedicated to exploring the various facets of Cricket.
